## 🎯 Rules to Remember (Manager's Feedback)

- ❌ **Never say** "On this slide..." or "If you look at slide 3..."
- ❌ **Don't read** what's already on screen — they can read it themselves
- ✅ **Tell the story** — talk about the WHY, not just WHAT
- ✅ **Speak like you're explaining to a friend** — not presenting to a board
- ✅ **Pause between sections** — let things land before moving on
- ✅ **Keep it conversational** — it's okay to say "honestly" or "I realized"

## THE SCRIPT

---

### 🟣 OPENING (Title Slide)
**⏱️ ~30 seconds**

> "Hi everyone, thanks for joining. I'm Manprit, and today I'll walk you through what I worked on in Q3.
>
> The short version? I found two things that were slowing our teams down — and I built solutions for both. Let me tell you how that happened."

**💡 Tip:** Don't linger here. Say it, smile, move on. The title slide is just a door — walk through it.

---

### 🟣 MY QUARTER — What Happened (Slide 2)
**⏱️ ~1 minute**

> "At the start of the quarter, I spent some time talking to different people — developers, QA, managers. And the same two complaints kept coming up.
>
> The first one was about React project setup. Every team was building their own from scratch. No shared standard. Some did it well, others just cut corners because it took too long. And I kept thinking — why is everyone doing this separately?
>
> The second one was about build failures. When something broke, most people couldn't figure out why. The logs are long, confusing — and usually only one or two people on the team knew how to read them. Everyone else just waited.
>
> Those two problems became my focus for the quarter."

**💡 Tip:** This is your storytelling moment. Slow down here. Let the audience feel the frustration. You're painting a picture — not listing bullet points.

---

### 🟣 REACT UNIFIEDCI — The Problem (Slide 3)
**⏱️ ~1 minute**

> "So let's start with the first one — React UnifiedCI.
>
> The problem was simple. Every React team was setting up their own build process. Some teams had great quality checks, others had almost none. When one team found a fix, the other teams never got it. And setting up a new project properly? That could take 2 to 3 days easy.
>
> I thought — what if I just build this once, and everyone uses it? One system, same quality, zero setup effort for the team."

**💡 Tip:** Point to the Before vs After visual on screen but don't read it out. Just say *"You can see the difference here"* and let them look.

---

### 🟣 REACT UNIFIEDCI — How It Works (Slide 4)
**⏱️ ~45 seconds**

> "And the best part is — teams don't have to do anything extra. They just connect their project, and everything runs on its own.
>
> A developer pushes their code, quality checks run automatically, tests run, a report is generated, and the team gets notified. The whole thing is hands-off.
>
> That was my design goal — zero extra work for the team."

**💡 Tip:** Walk through the flow diagram on screen with your hand/cursor briefly. Keep it quick. Don't explain each box in detail.

---

### 🟣 REACT UNIFIEDCI — Value (Slide 5)
**⏱️ ~1 minute**

> "So what does this actually mean for the organization?
>
> First — time. Project setup went from days to minutes. And this happens for every new React project, so the saving keeps adding up.
>
> Second — quality. Bug checks happen on their own now. Nobody has to remember to do them. Fewer problems slip through.
>
> Third — if I fix something once, every team gets it. No chasing people for updates.
>
> And fourth — developers just focus on building features now. They don't touch the setup."

**💡 Tip:** This is the slide HR cares about the most. Slow down. Let the numbers on the banner speak — just glance at them and say *"90% faster setup, 100% automated checks."*

---

### 🟣 JENKINS MCP — The Problem (Slide 6)
**⏱️ ~1.5 minutes**

> "Okay, now the second project — Jenkins MCP.
>
> Here's what I noticed. When a build breaks, most people on the team can't figure out why. The logs are thousands of lines long, full of technical jargon. So what happens? Everyone waits for that one person who knows how to read them.
>
> And if that person is in a meeting, or on leave? The whole team is stuck.
>
> QA wanted to know 'what failed?' Managers wanted to know 'is this ready to release?' But they couldn't check on their own — they always had to ask someone and wait.
>
> I thought — what if anyone could just ask a question and get a straight answer? No log reading, no waiting."

**💡 Tip:** This is your strongest storytelling moment. The pain is very relatable. Pause after "the whole team is stuck." Let it land.

---

### 🟣 JENKINS MCP — The Solution (Slide 7)
**⏱️ ~45 seconds**

> "So I connected Jenkins — our build system — with AI. Now instead of reading logs, you just ask a question. Like asking a colleague. And you get a clear answer in seconds.
>
> You can see the difference here — before, it was five steps of manual searching. Now? One question, one answer."

**💡 Tip:** Brief. The Before vs After visual does the heavy lifting. Don't over-explain.

---

### 🟣 JENKINS MCP — Who Uses It (Slide 8)
**⏱️ ~45 seconds**

> "And the nice thing is — it works for everyone, not just developers.
>
> A developer asks 'why did my build fail?' and gets the exact error with a fix. A QA person asks 'show me everything that failed today' and gets a clean summary. A manager asks 'is this ready to go live?' and gets a yes or no.
>
> It adapts to whoever is asking."

**💡 Tip:** If you want, you can roleplay the questions slightly — change your tone for each persona. Makes it memorable. But keep it natural, don't force it.

---

### 🟣 JENKINS MCP — Value (Slide 9)
**⏱️ ~1 minute**

> "What value does this bring?
>
> Debugging went from hours to minutes. People get that time back for their actual work.
>
> Nobody's stuck waiting for that one expert anymore. Anyone can get answers on their own.
>
> QA and managers check things themselves — no pinging developers, no meetings needed.
>
> And overall, less waiting means faster decisions, faster releases."

**💡 Tip:** Same as React value slide — let the banner numbers breathe. Quick glance: *"70% less debugging time, zero dependency on experts."*

---

### 🟣 OVERALL IMPACT (Slide 10)
**⏱️ ~45 seconds**

> "Zooming out — both projects are doing the same thing. Removing the stuff that slows people down.
>
> One fixes project setup. The other fixes problem-solving. Together, teams work smoother and more independently.
>
> Every project follows the same standard now. And people don't have to wait for others to get things done."

**💡 Tip:** Keep this brief. It's a summary — not a new section. In and out.

---

### 🟣 LEARNINGS (Slide 11)
**⏱️ ~1 minute**

> "This quarter taught me a few things.
>
> The biggest one — listen first. The best ideas I had came from talking to people about what frustrated them. Not from looking at code.
>
> I also learned that AI isn't about replacing people — it's about giving everyone access to answers that used to live in one person's head.
>
> And probably the most important one — start with the real problem. Not with what sounds technically impressive. The biggest impact comes from fixing actual pain."

**💡 Tip:** Pick 2-3 learnings you genuinely connect with. Don't read all 6 cards. Say *"There are a few more here, but the ones that really stuck with me are..."*

---

### 🟣 Q4 PLANS (Slide 12)
**⏱️ ~2 minutes**

> "Looking ahead to Q4 — I want to do two things. Keep building on what I started, and take on two new challenges.
>
> For the Q3 work — I want to get more teams using React UnifiedCI and make it the default. And for Jenkins MCP, I want to connect it to Slack so people can ask questions right from their chat.
>
> For new work — I'm picking up Android CI/CD. Same idea as what I did for React, but for Android apps. Right now Android teams also set up everything from scratch. I want to fix that.
>
> And the second one is ML-powered node selection. Today we guess which server to run builds on. Sometimes we pick one that's too big — waste of money. Sometimes too small — builds fail. I want to use machine learning to predict the right size based on past data.
>
> I'm excited about both of these. From Android, I'll learn how mobile builds work — signing, flavors, device testing. From the ML project, I'll learn how to apply machine learning to real infrastructure problems, not just theory."

**💡 Tip:** Show genuine excitement here. This is forward-looking — HR loves seeing initiative and ambition. End this section with energy.

---

### 🟣 THANK YOU (Slide 13)
**⏱️ ~15 seconds**

> "That's pretty much it. Thanks for listening, and I'm happy to go deeper on any of this. Any questions?"

**💡 Tip:** Smile. Stop talking. Wait for questions. Don't fill the silence.

## 🎤 General Presentation Tips

### Things That Make You Look Good
1. **Pause after key points.** Silence = confidence. Don't rush to fill gaps.
2. **Use "I noticed..." and "I thought..."** — it shows ownership and initiative.
3. **Glance at the screen, then talk to the camera.** On Teams, camera = eye contact.
4. **Keep water nearby.** Take a sip between sections — it's a natural pause.
5. **If someone asks a question you don't know** — say *"That's a great question, let me check and get back to you."* Never bluff.

### Things That Make You Look Bad
1. ❌ Reading the slide out loud
2. ❌ Saying "On this slide..." or "Next slide shows..."
3. ❌ Rushing through everything to finish on time
4. ❌ Saying "um" or "like" too much — pause instead
5. ❌ Over-explaining technical details to HR — they don't need it

### The Golden Rule
> **Talk about WHY you did something, not WHAT you did.**
> HR cares about the problem you solved and the impact it had — not the technology you used.
